# rhessi_ospex

A pdf tutorial introducing solar X-ray spectra, data from RHESSI and fitting it in sswidl using OSPEX. Use at your own risk - no support given.

Originally from the SOLAIRE SODAS meeting in Glasgow back in 2009. So basics in it should still be fine but most of this designed from 2009, see the main [RHESSI](https://hesperia.gsfc.nasa.gov/rhessi3/software/resources/index.html) or [OSPEX](https://hesperia.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssw/packages/spex/doc/ospex_explanation.htm) page for more modern approaches.
